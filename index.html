    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Exzo Jordan and welcome to my personal website built with HTML and CSS</p>

    <h1>Purpose</h1>

    <p>This website is designed to showcase my skills and accomplishments. As I continue to grow as a software engineer, I will update it to fully reflect my potential</p>

    <h1>Web Design</h1>

    <p>The style of this website was inspired by Appleâ€™s iOS 26 software update with its liquid glass design. Although not identical, it is similar</p>
